It's very simple project in python to create a static presentation. I hope someone does it profit or want to [contribute][hyhyhy-gh] to the project.

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<a href="http://maciejczyzewski.github.io/hyhyhy/" target="_blank"><h3>hyhyhy</h3></a>
</div>

I wanted to create something simpler, nicer and more efficient. And also thing that works on all devices and browsers in every format. 

The goal was to make package that will speed up work on own speech.
